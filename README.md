# spotify-albums-search

This was a quick app to get familiar with React as well as using the Spotify API to be able to search for albums. Replace the token with a new token requested from https://developer.spotify.com/console/get-search-item/?q=kanye&type=album&market=US&limit=10&offset= before running to use it.
